title: How Did I Build My Website?

## Motivation

In the past, I built several portfolios primarily to showcase my small projects when I was learning programming and job hunting. These portfolios were unnecessarily complex, built with frameworks like [React.js](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). The most recent one can be found [here](https://vnngu.vercel.app/).

After landing my first programming job, I neglected my portfolio, neither updating it nor writing any blog posts. At the beginning of 2025, I decided to make a "fresh start" by rebuilding my website with a simpler UI and without any JavaScript front-end frameworks.

As I have grown in my programming career, I have become more interested in understanding how technologies work under the hood and sharing my thoughts on topics that intrigue me. This new website will become a dedicated space for both exploration and writing.
