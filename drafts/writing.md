title: How Did I Build My Website?
lang: en
...

## Motivation

In the past, I built several portfolios to mainly showcase my small projects
when I was learning programming and job hunting. These portfolios were unnecessarily
complex, built with [React.js](https://react.dev) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
The most recent one can be found [here](https://vnngu.vercel.app/). After landing
my first programming job, I neglected the portfolio, neither updating it nor writing
any blog posts. At the beginning of 2025, I decided to make a "fresh start" by
rebuilding my website with a simpler UI and without any JavaScript front-end frameworks/libraries.

As I have grown in my programming career, I have become more interested in
understanding how technologies work under the hood and sharing my thoughts on
topics that intrigue me. This new website will become a space for both exploration and writing.

## Tech stack

The source code of my website can be found [here](https://github.com/namvnngu/namvnngu.github.io).

A list of the major technologies I have used for my website:
