title: How Did I Build My Website?

## Motivation

In the past, I built some portfolios to mainly showcase my small projects
when I was learning programming and job hunting. These portfolios were unnecessarily
complex, built with [React.js](https://react.dev) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
The most recent one can be found [here](https://vnngu.vercel.app/). After landing
my first programming job, I neglected the portfolio, neither updating it nor
writing any blog posts. At the beginning of 2025, I decided to make a "fresh start"
by rebuilding my website with a simpler UI and without any JavaScript front-end
frameworks/libraries.

As I have grown in my programming career, I have become more interested in
understanding how technologies work under the hood and sharing my thoughts on
topics that intrigue me. This new website will become a space for both exploration
and writing.

The source code of my website can be found [here](https://github.com/namvnngu/namvnngu.github.io).

## Tech stack

Here are the major technologies I have used to build my website:

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) defines the website's
structure and content.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) specifies the website's
styling.
- [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) defines scripts for building
the website, deploying the website and updating repeated HTML blocks across pages.
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) defines custom commands and
automates repeated tasks such as running a development server, building the website,
deploying the website, and cleaning up.
- [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed) updates repeated HTML blocks.
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) converts Markdown to HTML.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) hosts the website.
