# My Website

The major technologies I have used to build [my website](https://namvnngu.github.io):

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) defines the website's
structure and content.
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) specifies the website's
styling.
- [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) defines scripts for building
the website, deploying the website and updating repeated HTML blocks across pages.
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) defines custom commands and
automates repeated tasks such as running a development server, building the website,
deploying the website, and cleaning up.
- [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed) updates repeated HTML blocks.
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) converts Markdown to HTML.
